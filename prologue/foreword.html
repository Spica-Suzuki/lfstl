       Benim Linuxu ogrenme ve daha iyi anlama seruvenim 1998'de basladi. 
       Ilk Linux dagitimimi yukledigim anda
       Linuxun ardindaki tum konsept ve felsefesine karsi merak salmistim.
        
        
      </p>
      <p>
        Tek bir gorevi yerine getirebilmek icin her zaman cok fazla secenek vardir.
        Aynisi Linux dagitimlari icin de soylenilebilir. iyi olanlar yillar boyu var oldu.
        bazilari hala var, bazilari baska bir seye donustu ve digerleri hatiralarimiz haline geldi.
        Bunlarin hepsi hedef kitlenin ihtiyaclarina uyabilmek icin farkli seyler yaptilar.
        Ayni bitis noktasina gelebilmenin pek cok farkli yolu oldugundan, I began to
        realize I no longer had to be limited by any one implementation.
        Prior to discovering Linux, we simply put up with issues in other
        Operating Systems as you had no choice. It was what it was, whether
        you liked it or not. With Linux, the concept of choice began to
        emerge. If you didn't like something, you were free, even encouraged,
        to change it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sayica cok Linux dagitimi denedim ve herhangi birinde karar kilamadim.
        kendi dogrularina gore harika sistemlerdi. Artik dogru ve yanlis meselesi degildi.
        Kisisel tercih haline gelmisti.
        With all that choice available, it became apparent that there would
        not be a single system that would be perfect for me. So I set out to
        create my own Linux system that would fully conform to my personal
        preferences.
      </p>
      <p>
        To truly make it my own system, I resolved to compile everything from
        source code instead of using pre-compiled binary packages. This
        <span class="quote">&ldquo;<span class=
        "quote">perfect</span>&rdquo;</span> Linux system would have the
        strengths of various systems without their perceived weaknesses. At
        first, the idea was rather daunting. I remained committed to the idea
        that such a system could be built.
      </p>
      <p>
        After sorting through issues such as circular dependencies and
        compile-time errors, I finally built a custom-built Linux system. It
        was fully operational and perfectly usable like any of the other
        Linux systems out there at the time. But it was my own creation. It
        was very satisfying to have put together such a system myself. The
        only thing better would have been to create each piece of software
        myself. This was the next best thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I shared my goals and experiences with other members of the Linux
        community, it became apparent that there was a sustained interest in
        these ideas. It quickly became plain that such custom-built Linux
        systems serve not only to meet user specific requirements, but also
        serve as an ideal learning opportunity for programmers and system
        administrators to enhance their (existing) Linux skills. Out of this
        broadened interest, the <span class="emphasis"><em>Linux From Scratch
        Project</em></span> was born.
      </p>
      <p>
        This Linux From Scratch book is the central core around that project.
        It provides the background and instructions necessary for you to
        design and build your own system. While this book provides a template
        that will result in a correctly working system, you are free to alter
        the instructions to suit yourself, which is, in part, an important
        part of this project. You remain in control; we just lend a helping
        hand to get you started on your own journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        I sincerely hope you will have a great time working on your own Linux
        From Scratch system and enjoy the numerous benefits of having a
        system that is truly your own.
